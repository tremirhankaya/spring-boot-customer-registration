Spring Boot Customer Registration System
---
This project is a simple demonstration of fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Data JPA**. The main goal of this project is to practice and solidify the basics of the **Spring MVC** pattern and **Thymeleaf**, which are standard for web application development in Spring.

Project Highlights
---
- **Spring Boot**: The project is built on the Spring Boot framework for rapid application development.
- **Spring MVC**: Uses the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate concerns and create a web interface.
- **Thymeleaf**: A server-side templating engine used for dynamic HTML pages.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Uses _JpaRepository_ for efficient data access with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Service Layer**: A layer of abstraction is introduced (_CustomerService_) to encapsulate business logic.
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses a PostgreSQL database to store customer data.

Getting Started
---
Prerequisites

- **Java 21** or higher
- **Maven**
- **PostgreSQL** database

Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/emirhankaya/spring-boot-customer-registration.git

2. **Database Configuration:** The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create a `application-local.properties` file in `src/main/resources` and add your connection details there.
   _spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name_
   _spring.datasource.username=your_username_
   _spring.datasource.password=your_password_

3. **Run the application:** You can run the main application class directly from your IDE or use Maven.
   _mvn spring-boot:run_
